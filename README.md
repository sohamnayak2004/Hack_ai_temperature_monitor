# Hack_ai_temperature_monitor
This repository hosts a Temperature Monitoring Agent designed to monitor temperature levels in a specified location. If the temperature deviates from the user's desired range, the agent will send a text message notification. This project was created specifically for the Hack.ai Hackathon organized by Techfest IIT Bombay and Fetch.ai.
